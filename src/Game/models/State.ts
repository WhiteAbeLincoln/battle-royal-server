/*
Ways to reason about our state over time:
1. The state is an object which gets modified at points in time
2. The state is a stream of actions that modify an existing state and return a new state
3. State is a set of properties objects which react to actions over time, producing a new state with a changed property.
   These streams are merged to get the final state stream
4. State is a set of property streams. Each property is its own observable which subscribes to action streams
